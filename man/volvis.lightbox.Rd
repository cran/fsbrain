\usage{
volvis.lightbox(
  volume,
  slices = -5,
  axis = 1L,
  per_row = 5L,
  per_col = NULL,
  border_geometry = "5x5",
  background_color = "#000000",
  arrange_single_image = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{volume}{3D array, can be numeric (gray-scale intensity values) or color strings. If numeric, the intensity values must be in range `[0, 1]`.}

\item{slices}{slice index definition. If a vector of integers, interpreted as slice indices. If a single negative interger `-n`, interpreted as every `nth` slice, starting at slice 1. The character string 'all' or the value `NULL` will be interpreted as *all slices*.}

\item{axis}{positive integer in range 1L..3L, the axis to use.}

\item{per_row}{positive integer, the number of subimages per row in the output image. If `NULL`, automatically computed from the number of slices and the `per_col` parameter.}

\item{per_col}{positive integer, the number of subimages per column in the output image. If `NULL`, automatically computed from the number of slices and the `per_row` parameter.}

\item{border_geometry}{string, a geometry string passed to \code{magick::image_border} to define the borders to add to each image tile. The default value adds 5 pixels, both horizontally and vertically.}

\item{background_color}{string, a valid ImageMagick color string such as "white" or "#000080". The color to use when extending images (e.g., when creating the border). Defaults to black.}

\item{arrange_single_image}{logical, whether to apply the given arrangement (from parameters `per_row` and `per_column`) even if a single slice (a 2D image) is passed as `volume`. Defaults to FALSE, which prevents that background tiles are added to fill the row up to `per_row` images. This also prevents the border from getting added to a single image, so all you see is the raw image. Set to `TRUE` if you want to arrange even a single image in a row with a border.}
}
\description{
A lightbox is a single image that holds a set of subimages, arranged in a grid. The images can have a small border or spacing between them. Consecutive subimages will be appear the same row of the grid.

If overlay_colors are given, the volume will be used as the background, and it will only be visible where overlay_colors has transparency.
