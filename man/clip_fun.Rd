\title{Get data clipping function.}
\usage{
clip_fun(lower = 0.05, upper = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{lower}{numeric. The probability for the lower quantile, defaults to `0.05`.}

\item{upper}{numeric. The probability for the upper quantile, defaults to `0.95`.}
}
\value{
a function that takes as argument the data, and clips it to the requested range. I.e., values outside the range will be set to the closest border value. Designed to be used as \code{rglactions$trans_fun} in vis functions, to limit the colorbar and data range.
}
\description{
Get data clipping function to use in \code{\link{rglactions}} as 'trans_fun' to transform data. This is typically used to limit the colorbar in a plot to a certain range. This uses percentiles to clip. Clipping means that values more extreme than the g√≠ven quantiles will be set to the quantile values.
}
\examples{
   rglactions = list("trans_fun"=clip_fun(0.10, 0.90));
   rglactions = list("trans_fun"=clip_fun());
   f = clip_fun();
   f(rnorm(100));
